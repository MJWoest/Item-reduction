These files were ment to work as a package (but a package was not yet created), thus this code only works like a package.

Read the "Worksheet" file well, this should explain how these functions should be used.

These functions are able to transform output from the CHAID algoritm into a LimeSurvey Questionnaire. In order to work the LimeSurvey questionnaire should be downloaded as .xlsx.

To import the questoinnaire it has to be saved as .txt when the functions have been used.

If it does not work, dont hesitate to contact me.
